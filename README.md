## A user friendly web app that provides up-to-date water quality statistics for your local area

Christchurch’s drinking water is one of the best water supplies in the world. It is drawn from aquifers deep underground. It is regularly tested and maintained in line with the Drinking Water Standards for New Zealand. However, not everyone has access to a Council managed supply. Communities in rural areas may their own water supply. In the rural areas of Canterbury, agriculture is more prominent, [cow urine](https://www.phcc.org.nz/briefing/nitrate-contamination-drinking-water-and-adverse-birth-outcomes-emerging-evidence) and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer are used predominantly by the dairy industry and are leading sources of nitrate contamination. Private sources of water like domestic self-supplies are not subject to any monitoring, [which creates a risk to public health](https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/Freshwater/risks-associated-with-nitrates-in-drinking-water.pdf). \

“Should I Drink?” is a web app designed to bridge this gap in monitoring your water quality in the Canterbury Region. Users can input their location through a search bar to receive daily data on the five nearest wells. The data is pubically avaiable and is sourced from Evniornment Canterbury. The data used in our web app is updated regularly. 

The data is compared against accepted drinking water standards. The app visualizes these comparisons, highlighting any deviations from safe levels from various biological contaminants like E. coli and chemical contaminants such as nitrates. This empowers Canterbury residents with crucial information about their water quality, helping them make informed decisions to protect their health.
